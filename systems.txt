gameboy color: 160 x 144
DS: 256 × 192 (Could require 2 screens which would be expensive).
advance:  240 × 160
psp: 480 × 272 (Don't know any emulators for this).
gamecube: 640x480 (Limits us to the first screen, or a hdmi out to tv).
playstation 1: 640x480(Limits us to the first screen, or a hdmi out to tv. Additionally it is not clear if the is a emulator for this at the moment).

Notes:
The best plan would probably support the gameboy advanced, as that also gives you gameboy color capabilities. Alternatively if we go to none portable systems both the gamecube and playstation 1 would be good routes to follow.
